# UROP
The university of Minnesota, Duluth offers a program titled 'Undergraduate Research Opprotunity Program'. This program involves undergraduate students creating and proposing potential projects from any discipline. For my project, I worked with Aaron Lingwall, the lab coordinator of the X-ray Flouresence (XRF) Analyzer, to help automate the process of standardizing and calibrating the output from that analyzer. There was also another utility program to help concentrate the output files.


# Background
The  XRF analyzer, simply, is a machine to find out the concentration of different elements in rock/mud/dirt of rock cores ranging from 1-180 cm. A rock core is a cylindrical shaped sample taken from deep within the earth. These cores are then seperated, with one being archive and one being destroyable. The XRF Lab is sent the archived half, as the XRF analyzer does not physically impact the sample. These cores are part of a large
